# Auto Connect Open Vpn

<img align="center" alt="IMAGE GUI" src="https://github.com/gabrielgollo/auto-connect-opvpn/blob/main/static/GUI.png">

This is a Java project that has a GUI to automate the process of connection to OpenVpn, especially when 
you need 2-factor auth to log-in.

So it has a cron to check if the connection to vpn is online, and if not, it'll reestablish connection.
